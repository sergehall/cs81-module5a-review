# REFLECTION

**What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?**  
By reading and commenting on the code, I got a better understanding of how higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` work. I saw how they help process arrays in a clean and powerful way. It also helped me learn how to write more reusable functions by passing in parameters like field names and thresholds. Writing comments forced me to think about what each line of code actually does, which made everything clearer.

**What was the most confusing part?**  
At first, `reduce()` was the most confusing part. I wasn’t sure how the accumulator worked and how it combined values. I had to look it up and run a few simple examples before I really understood how it adds up values across the array. Also, I realized that writing more general functions takes practice — making something reusable without breaking its logic is a challenge for me as a beginner.
